<h1>Stained Glass </h1>
    <p> There's something about stained glass that soothes the soul! <br>“People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, <br>but when the darkness sets in, 
     their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.” <br>(Elisabeth Kübler-Ross) </p>
